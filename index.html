          <p>
            <b>Background: The Challenge of Anomaly Detection in Microservice Systems</b><br>
            Microservice architecture has become the de-facto paradigm for constructing large software systems due to its tremendous advantages in agility and scalability. In a microservice system, numerous microservices work together to handle user requests, with each microservice being independently developed, tested, deployed, and upgraded. However, the rapid changes of each microservice and the increasing intricacy of microservices interactions tend to incur faults that cause errors and lead to system failures if anomalies are not accurately detected and corresponding measures are not taken. Therefore, accurate anomaly detection is crucial for guaranteeing the reliability of microservice systems.
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>The Problem: Two Fundamental Challenges</b><br>
            Existing anomaly detection methods face two intrinsic challenges in microservice systems. <b>First, heterogeneous technical stacks and intricate dependencies</b> between microservices make a single type of runtime data (logs, metrics, or traces) incapable of revealing all types of anomalies. This necessitates the comprehensive utilization of multimodal data. <b>Second, frequent updates and highly dynamic dependencies</b> make it impractical to obtain up-to-date and sufficient labeled data to build anomaly detection models. The rapid evolution of microservices renders old label data obsolete, while the complexity of interactions makes accurate human labeling extremely costly and time-consuming.
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>Our Solution: ALARM - Cross-system Anomaly Detection with Multimodal Transfer Learning</b><br>
            We introduce ALARM, a novel anomaly detection method that addresses both challenges simultaneously by <b>leveraging existing labeled multimodal data from other systems to build effective anomaly detection models for the target microservice system</b>. This approach, which we refer to as Cross-system Anomaly Detection using Multimodal data (CADM), eliminates the need for additional labeled data from the target system while fully utilizing multimodal runtime data.
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>Key Technical Innovations:</b><br>
            To overcome the obstacles posed by complex relationships and inconsistency in data quality across modalities and domains, ALARM employs two key techniques:
            <ul>
              <li><span style="color: red"><b>User Call-based Graph Fusion Method:</b></span> This approach effectively models inter-modal and inter-microservices relationships by organizing multimodal data generated under the same user call into unified graph embeddings, preserving service invocation topologies and operational context.</li>
              <li><span style="color: red"><b>Contrastive Learning with Virtual Sample Generation:</b></span> This technique balances cross-modal and cross-domain learning processes, increasing diversity from both aspects and thereby alleviating overfitting in modalities and domains.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>Results:</b> Experiments on an open-source benchmark microservice system and a real-world industrial microservice system demonstrate the effectiveness of ALARM. Without requiring additional labeled data from the target system, ALARM outperforms existing unsupervised methods and cross-system anomaly detection models, achieving a <b>16.38% improvement in F1 score</b>.

               <b>Novel Task Formulation:</b> We introduce the Cross-system Anomaly Detection using Multimodal data (CADM) task, which addresses the challenges of heterogeneous modality data and scarce labels in microservice systems in a holistic way. This task formulation enables building effective anomaly detection models for target systems without requiring labeled data from those systems.

               <b>Innovative Method Design:</b> We propose ALARM, a novel anomaly detection method specifically tailored for the CADM task. ALARM introduces a user call-based graph fusion approach to model complex inter-modal and inter-microservices relationships, effectively extracting transferable knowledge from multimodal runtime data. The method employs contrastive learning to balance cross-modal and cross-domain learning processes, while virtual sample generation enhances diversity, addressing modal and domain overfitting issues.

         <div class="content has-text-justified">
   <p>Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) monitor microservice systems by relying on three key types of runtime data—traces, logs, and metrics. Each modality captures distinct aspects of system behavior and embodies unique structural characteristics:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><b>Traces:</b> Reveal service invocation topologies as tree-like call graphs with unique trace IDs and span IDs. They document response times and status codes, providing spatial information about service dependencies and invocation paths, thereby enhancing system transparency and enabling the understanding of request flows across microservices.</li>
     <li><b>Logs:</b> Semi-structured textual outputs containing timestamps, log levels, and operational event details. They capture temporal sequences of events and semantic information about system state transitions, allowing SREs to infer what happened and when during system execution.</li>
     <li><b>Metrics:</b> Performance indicators (e.g., CPU utilization, memory consumption, request rates) collected at regular intervals into multi-dimensional time series. They reflect temporal fluctuations in system performance and resource utilization, providing quantitative measures of system health.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Each modality encapsulates complementary information—spatial (traces), temporal (metrics and logs), and semantic (logs)—that together provide a comprehensive view of system behavior. SREs integrate these multimodal data sources to assess the operational health and performance of microservice systems, as anomalies may manifest differently across modalities.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Method Overview</h2>
          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>ALARM consists of three main phases that work together to enable effective cross-system anomaly detection using multimodal transfer learning:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>Feature Extraction Phase:</b>
                  In this phase, transferable anomaly-relevant information is extracted from heterogeneous modalities (traces, logs, metrics). Specifically, log semantics are captured through text encoders, metric patterns are extracted via time series encoders, and trace information (response times, status codes, invocation paths) is encoded through graph-based encoders. All features are mapped into a unified feature space via modality-specific encoders, enabling cross-modal knowledge transfer.
               </li>
               <li><b>User Call-based Graph Fusion Phase:</b>
                  This phase addresses the challenge of modeling complex inter-modal and inter-microservices relationships. A user call-based graph fusion method organizes multimodal data generated under the same user call into unified graph embeddings. This approach preserves service invocation topologies (from traces), operational context (from logs), and performance characteristics (from metrics) in a single graph structure. A Graph Autoencoder (GAE) then fuses these embeddings into a unified vector representation, capturing cross-modal dependencies while enabling reversible decoding to retain intra-modal details. This fusion strategy effectively bridges the modal gap by leveraging the natural relationships established through user call flows.
               </li>
               <li><b>Multimodal Transfer Learning Phase:</b>
                  This phase tackles the domain gap between source and target systems. Contrastive learning is employed to promote cross-modal and cross-domain information interaction, balancing the learning processes and ensuring that knowledge is effectively transferred across both modalities and domains. Virtual sample generation techniques are integrated to enhance modal and domain diversity, creating augmented training samples that help mitigate overfitting in both modalities and domains. This dual strategy ensures robust generalization to target systems with different characteristics.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The three phases work synergistically: feature extraction provides transferable representations, graph fusion models complex relationships, and transfer learning ensures effective knowledge transfer to target systems.</p>

            Employing multimodal transfer learning techniques to solve the CADM task faces two main obstacles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Complex Relationships:</b> The intricate dependencies between microservices and the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data (traces, logs, metrics) create complex inter-modal and inter-microservices relationships that are difficult to model effectively. Traditional fusion methods fail to capture these relationships adequately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Data Quality Inconsistency:</b> Multimodal data from different systems exhibit significant variations in quality, distribution, and feature spaces. This inconsistency, combined with the scarcity of labeled data in target systems, leads to overfitting in both modalities and domains, hindering effective knowledge transfer.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>ALARM's Solutions:</b> To address these challenges, ALARM employs a user call-based graph fusion method that naturally models relationships through user call flows, and combines contrastive learning with virtual sample generation to enhance diversity and prevent overfitting. This dual strategy effectively bridges both the modal gap (differences between data modalities) and the domain gap (differences between source and target systems).

The results demonstrate that all key components—user call-based graph fusion, contrastive learning, and virtual sample generation—play crucial roles in improving the performance of ALARM. Removing any component leads to performance degradation, confirming that the integration of these techniques is essential for effective cross-system anomaly detection.

The results show that ALARM demonstrates relatively stable performance when the generation rate 𝛼 fluctuates between 0.1 and 0.7, indicating the robustness of our approach. This stability is crucial for practical deployment, as it reduces the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning when applying ALARM to new target systems. The analysis also provides guidance for parameter selection in real-world scenarios.

          <p>
              In real-world application scenarios, our method has successfully enhanced the anomaly detection performance of the Asia-Pacific region’s largest observability platform, Alibaba Cloud Observability Service. This service provides anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, and other service for multiple platforms, including Alibaba Group and Ant Group. To address diverse anomaly detection requirements across different platforms, we employ multimodal transfer learning to learn anomaly patterns from the multimodal observability data of existing systems and subsequently transfer this knowledge to target platforms. This approach improves the accuracy of anomaly detection, reduces strong dependence on alert instrumentation, significantly decreases the additional expert costs associated with instrumentation design, and enhances the effectiveness and practicality of Alibaba Cloud Observability in improving platform service reliability. ALARM is designed to address real-world challenges in microservice anomaly detection, making it highly applicable in practical production environments. ALARM tackles the Cross-system Anomaly Detection using Multimodal data (CADM) task, which aims to build effective anomaly detection models for target systems where labeled runtime data is unavailable, by leveraging abundant labeled multimodal runtime data from other systems. This section discusses how ALARM can be deployed and utilized in actual microservice systems.
